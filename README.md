# athletic_sales_analysis
module_5_challenge

The purpose of this exercise was to practice utilizing skills in Pandas, specifically groupby and pivot functions .

There are seven sections to this challenge
	1) The first section centers on brining in the csv file and combining the two tables
	
	2) The next section focuses on transforming the data by performing both a groupby and pivot table to determine which region sold the units.
	
	3) Section 3 is much like section 2, this time transforming the data using a groupby and pivot table to find which region had the highest dollar sales.
 
 4) Next, top retailers by total dollar sales are determined by utilizing both a grouby and pivot table.

 5) Section 5 focuses on transforming finding the retailer who sold the most units of women's athletic footwear. This step requried additional coding to remove apostrophe's from the data, then limit the data to just women's athletic footwear.

 6) Section 6 takes the women's athletic footwear grouping from section five and finds top dollar sales by day.

 7) Lastly, data from section 6 is resampled to view the top sales by week.
